How to use magproc in Windows

This is designed for chanel names in either column of [normalize](./AirMagTools/normalize.csv). 
If your datafile has chanel names not found in normalize, either:
    1) The columns are added the 'variation' column in normalize, and the appropriate name is matched in the 'normal' column.
        * this is the preferred method. Please fork the repository and make a pull request.
    2) The data file header needs fixed to accommodate the expected names

# Magnetic data processing pipeline

Based on an Oasis montaj python extension created by Eric Petersen at the DGGS (Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys https://dggs.alaska.gov; 2025-06-11).

The pipeline itself can be run either from a jupyter notebook or from
the command line using the "AirMagTools" command line utility.

If using Jupyter notebooks, additional tools provided to plot and QC data in
various ways as well as do simple data transformations (e.g. change
coordinate projection, merge datasets, etc).

Check out the [Example](example_notebooks/Example.ipynb) and
[gpr2025_4v2-tofty](example_notebooks/gpr2025_4v2-tofty.ipynb) jupyter notebooks for
basic usage.

To install, simply run `pip install .`.

Additional tools for viewing the results of AirMagTools in Geosoft's Oasis Montaj can be found here: https://github.com/SagebrushGeoTools/OM_tools_to_support_AirMagTools

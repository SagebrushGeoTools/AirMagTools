# Magnetic data processing pipeline

Based on an Oasis montaj python extension created by by Eric Petersen at the DGGS (Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys; 2025-06-11).

The pipeline itself can be run either from a jupyter notebook or from
the command line using the "AirMagTools" command line utility.

Jupyter notebooks additionally provide tools to plot and QC data in
various ways as well as do simple data transformations (e.g. change
map projection, merge datasets).

Check out the [Example](example_notebooks/Example.ipynb) jupyter notebook for basic usage.

To install, simply run `pip install .`.

This project is made possible thanks to the generous support of our community and our key financial backers.

A special thank you to Aqua Geo Frameworks for their major private contribution, which allowed us to get SagebrushGeoTools off the ground,
 and specifically, build AirMagTools. Please visit their website and think of them first if you are in need of building a 
high-resolution, 3D geologic framework!
